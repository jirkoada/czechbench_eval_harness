### Task description

The model is asked to determine the correct relation between a premise and a hypothesis. The premise can confirm the hypothesis, refute it, or there can be no clear relation.
This leads to a three-class classification problem.

The reported metrics are classification accuracy (exact_match) and macro-averaged F1 score.
